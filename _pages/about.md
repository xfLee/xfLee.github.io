I’m a Ph.D. candidate student in management science and engineering at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the advisor [Prof. Xiu-li Liu](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/73790773e2f24c62a39f641c89ade596/myHomePage.html). My research interests include **economy simulation and input-output analysis, revenue management(e.g. pricing and promotion), applicable modeling and optimization methods of path planning and intelligent dispatch problems**. I’m also interested in **data science(DS)** and **artificial intelligence(AI)** technology and spend lots of time applying optimization, machine learning and deep learning methods for advancing better machine and commercial intelligence, e.g. sale quantity prediction in retail convenience store. I've worked for many internet companies, participated in several industry projects. More details can be found in [**Projects**](https://xflee.github.io//projects/). Since 2019, I paid more attention to academy for making good research. And now I'm  working on several papers.
