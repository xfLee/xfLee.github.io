I’m a Ph.D. in management science and engineering of university of chinese academy of sciences (UCAS). My research interests include **business model analysis and evaluation**, **financial report analysis** and applicable modeling and optimization methods for **multiplex network regression** and **statistical graph**. I’m also interested in **data science(DS)** and **artificial intelligence(AI)** technology and spend lots of time applying optimization, machine learning and deep learning methods for advancing better machine and commercial intelligence, e.g. artificial intelligence in business management and computational business models. I've worked for some internet companies, participated in several industry projects. Since 2019, I paid more attention to academy for making good research. And now I am currently presiding over several provincial and departmental scientific research projects. More details can be found in [Projects](https://xflee.github.io//projects/).
