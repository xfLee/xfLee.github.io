excerpt: 'We consider multiplex networks in which there are redundant or noisy impacting relations on node interactions. Researchers have studied the generalised hypergeometric ensembles of random graphs (gHypEG) regression in order to model the relation influence on the interaction counts. However, some relations may be useless in explaining the propensities of connecting different vertex pairs in the observed interaction network. To address this issue, we propose a general framework of sparse multiplex network regression (sparseGHypEG), introducing the $\ell_1$ regularization into the gHypEG regression model. We also give theoretical guarantees of sparseGHypEG (e.g. the approximation convexity, estimate optimality and uniqueness). An extended alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is used to solve the approximation convex optimization problems. We construct a data set of sustainable business model innovation drivers. To show the power of sparseGHypEG regression, we apply it to the constructed and another empirical data sets. The results show that our proposed sparseGHypEG regression is powerful to shrinkage the redundant or noisy relations on interactions.'
